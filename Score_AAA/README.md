Music is [It Feels Good to be alive by Loyalty Freak Music](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Loyalty_Freak_Music).
You can find their website [here](https://loyaltyfreakmusic.com/)

All Arts were drawn by me with the help of [Pixel Studio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1204050/Pixel_Studio_for_pixel_art/) 
(free on Steam).

About inspiration for the top part, i took Yoshi Island, the middle part i googled pixel art city and look at images, 
for the last panel i just wanted a space effect, and seen one similar in Neptunia Shooter.
For the letters in the various "ok", "miss", "super", they were redrawn based on a Super Mario Bross 3 font image i
looked up [there] by BMATSANTOS.
